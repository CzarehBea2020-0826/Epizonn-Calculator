In this calculator, we used frame for making the screen, labels for putting digit buttons and another labels for function keys. A size of 300×400, with a title Epizónn Calculator that will appear above the display.

At first, the buttons appears but was not fuctionable. But by using partial from functools as another import the buttons in the calculator works. Also, the color of the calculator gives emphasis to its functions ( gray for numbers and decimal point, black for mathematical operations, red for equals, and yellow for both delete and clear all).
