User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. We aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable.

In this project we used Tkinter as a UI. 

Thr Ktinker package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems. (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)
